     <p> <em>Work in groups</em> </p>
       <p>
        (i) Identify and form four groups of objects according to their
          similarities.
       </p>
       <p>
        (ii) To each group add or subtract a number of items.
       </p>
       <p>
        (iii) Form and write expressions to represent the new number of items
        in each group.
       </p>
       <p>
        (iv) Discuss and share with other groups.
       </p>
        Learning point
        <p>
          The expressions formed are algebraic expressions. The expressions are
          in one unknown.
        </p>
            <example>
          <p>
          1. In a classroom of 30 learners there are <m>n</m> boys. Form an expression for
            the number of girls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Solution</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of girls is <m>30 - n</m>
          </p>
          <p>
          2. There are <m>x</m> mangoes and <m>y</m> orange trees in a farm.Form an expression
          for the total number of mango and orange trees in the farm.
          </p> 
        </example>

        <<em>example</em>>
                <p>
                  There are x mangoes and y orangenin a farm.  Form
                </p>
