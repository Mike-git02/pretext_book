                            The expressions formed are algebraic expressions. The expressions are
                            in one unknown.

                  <p>
                      In a classroom of 30 learners there are n boys. Form an expression for the number of girls.
                  </p>

                  <solution>
                      <p>
                          The number of girls is <m>30 - n</m>

                <p>
                  There are x mangoes and y oranges a farm.  Form an expression for the total number of mango and orange trees in the farm.
                </p>
                <solution>
                  <p>
                    The total number of mango and orange trees are <m>x + y.</m>

                      <p>
                        This is an algebraic expression with two unknowns.
