                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Identify and form four groups of objects according to their similarities.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          To each group add or subtract a number of items.
                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Form and write expressions to represent the new number of items in each group.
                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                            Discuss and share with other groups.

          <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  In a classroom of <m>30</m> learners there are <m>n</m> boys. Form an expression for the number of girls.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                  <p>
                    There are <m>n</m> boys in the classroom.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To get the number of girls take the total  number of students subtract the number of boys. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Therefore, it cab be represented as;
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Number of girls = <m>30 - n</m>
                  </p>

              </solution>
          </example>

          <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  There are <m>x</m> mangoes and <m>y</m> oranges a farm.  Form an expression for the total number of mango and orange trees in the farm.
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  The total number of mango trees are m <m>x</m> and that of orange trees are <m>y.</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  To find the total numbers of mango and orange trees in the farm we add both the number of orange and mango trees available
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, the total number of trees is = <m>x + y.</m>
                </p>
