            <p>
              Equating the masses on both sides leads to the formation of an equation.
            </p>

            <example>

              <statement>
                <p>
                  A Walibora bought a shirt and a pair of shorts. The cost of the pair of shorts was <m>150</m> shillings less than that of the shirt. If the two items cost <m>950</m> shillings. Write an equation representing the information using letter <m>x</m> as the cost of a shirt.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>

                <p>
                  The cost of one pair of shorts is <m>x - 150</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  The cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts can be represented using the expression shown below:
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>x + (x - 150) = 950</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Simplifying the equation, we get:
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>2x - 150 = 950</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thus the equation <m>2x - 150 = 950.</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Represents the cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts.
                </p>

              </solution>
