            <p>
              Equating the masses on both sides leads to the formation of an equation.
            </p>

            <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  A pupil bought a shirt and a pair of shorts. The cost of the pair of shorts was <m>150</m> shillings less than that of the shirt. If the two items cost <m>950</m> shillings. Write an equation representing the information using letter x as the cost of a shirt.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  The cost of one pair of shorts is <m>x - 150</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>x + (x - 150) = 950</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>2x - 150 = 950</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thus the equation <m>2x - 150 = 950.</m>
                </p>
              </solution>

              <li>
