          <p>
            Equating the masses on both sides leads to formation of a linear equaion.
          </p>

        <example>

          <statement>

            <p>
              A pupil bought a shirt and a pair of shorts. The cost of the pair of shorts was <m>150</m> <m>shillings</m> less than that of the shirt. If the two items cost <m>950</m> <m>shillings</m>. Write an equation representing the information using letter <m>x</m> as the cost of a shirt.
            </p>

          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              The cost of one pair of shorts is <m>x - 150</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>x + x - 150 = 950</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>2x - 150 = 950</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus the equation <m>2x - 150 = 950</m>.
            </p>

          </solution>
