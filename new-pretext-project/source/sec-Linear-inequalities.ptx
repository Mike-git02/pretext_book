                <p>Harriet visited a nutritionist. She was advised not to take more than two eggs in a day.
                She was also advised to be eating not less than three fruits in a day.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Why is it important to include fruits in our diet?</p></li>
            <li><p>How can we represent the above information using inequality symbols?</p></li>
              <hint>
                <p>The number of eggs in a day should be <em>less than or equal</em> to 2</p>
                  <p>Number of egg is <m>\le</m>2.</p>
                  <p>The number of fruits in day should be <em>greater or equal</em> to 3</p>
                <p>Number of fruits is <m>\ge</m>3</p>

                <p>Solution</p>
              <p>(a) 4 is less than 9 which is written as 4 &lt; 9</p>
